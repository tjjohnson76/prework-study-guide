# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

- This webpage was built to create an all in one study guide for the prework of the coding bootcamp.
- I built this project in order to have all of the information about the the basics of the bootcamp curriculum in one place that is easily accessible.
- This project solved the issue of taking down notes physically which can be lost or rendered useless by outside factors. This project also allowed me to demonstrate and practice a lot of the basics taught in the prework.
- I learned some of the different coding languages that I was more unfamiliar with during this project, such as CSS and HTML.
